# Graph Theory Project

This project explores various graph implementations using adjacency matrices and linked lists. It includes algorithms for BFS and DFS, applicable to different types of graphs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Java installed.
3. Navigate to the `src` directory.
4. Compile and run the Java files.

## Usage

The project supports four types of graphs: directed, undirected, weighted, and unweighted. To interact with the graphs, modify the Main.java file.

## File Structure
  
The src directory contains the source code files, including implementations of different graphs and graph algorithms.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome ! Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit a pull request.
